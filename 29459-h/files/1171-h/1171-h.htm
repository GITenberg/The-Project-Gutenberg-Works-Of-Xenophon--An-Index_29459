                 Xenophon the Athenian was born 431 B.C. He was a
                 pupil of Socrates. He marched with the Spartans,
                 and was exiled from Athens. Sparta gave him land
                 and property in Scillus, where he lived for many
                 years before having to move once more, to settle
                 in Corinth. He died in 354 B.C.

                 The Apology describes Socrates' state of mind at
                 his trial and execution, and especially his view
                 that it was better to die before senility set in
                 than to escape execution by humbling himself be-
                 fore an unjust persecution. Xenophon was away at
                 the time, involved in the events of the march of
                 the ten thousand.

    <h2>
      THE APOLOGY OF SOCRATES <a href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1"
      id="linknoteref-1"><small>1</small></a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among the reminiscences of Socrates, none, as it seems to me, is more
      deserving of record than the counsel he took with himself <a
      href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2"><small>2</small></a>
      (after being cited to appear before the court), not only with regard to
      his defence, but also as to the ending of his life. Others have written on
      this theme, and all without exception have touched upon <a
      href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a>
      the lofty style of the philosopher, <a href="#linknote-4"
      name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4"><small>4</small></a> which may be
      taken as a proof that the language used by Socrates was really of that
      type. But none of these writers has brought out clearly the fact that
      Socrates had come to regard death as for himself preferable to life; and
      consequently there is just a suspicion of foolhardiness in the arrogancy
      of his address. <a href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5"
      id="linknoteref-5"><small>5</small></a> We have, however, from the lips of
      one of his intimate acquaintances, Hermogenes, <a href="#linknote-6"
      name="linknoteref-6" id="linknoteref-6"><small>6</small></a> the son of
      Hipponicus, an account of him which shows the high demeanour in question
      to have been altogether in keeping with the master's rational purpose. <a
      href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7"><small>7</small></a>
      Hermogenes says that, seeing Socrates discoursing on every topic rather
      than that of his impending trial, he roundly put it to him whether he
      ought not to be debating the line of his defence, to which Socrates in the
      first instance answered: "What! do I not seem to you to have spent my
      whole life in meditating my defence?" And when Hermogenes asked him,
      "How?" he added: "By a lifelong persistence in doing nothing wrong, and
      that I take to be the finest practice for his defence which a man could
      devise." Presently reverting to the topic, Hermogenes demanded: "Do you
      not see, Socrates, how often Athenian juries <a href="#linknote-8"
      name="linknoteref-8" id="linknoteref-8"><small>8</small></a> are
      constrained by arguments to put quite innocent people to death, and not
      less often to acquit the guilty, either through some touch of pity excited
      by the pleadings, or that the defendant had skill to turn some charming
      phrase?" Thus appealed to, Socrates replied: "Nay, solemnly I tell you,
      twice already I have essayed to consider my defence, and twice the
      divinity <a href="#linknote-9" name="linknoteref-9" id="linknoteref-9"><small>9</small></a>
      hinders me"; and to the remark of Hermogenes, "That is strange!" he
      answered again: "Strange, do you call it, that to God it should seem
      better for me to die at once? Do you not know that up to this moment I
      will not concede to any man to have lived a better life than I have; since
      what can exceed the pleasure, which has been mine, of knowing <a
      href="#linknote-10" name="linknoteref-10" id="linknoteref-10"><small>10</small></a>
      that my whole life has been spent holily and justly? And indeed this
      verdict of self-approval I found re-echoed in the opinion which my friends
      and intimates have formed concerning me. <a href="#linknote-11"
      name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11"><small>11</small></a> And now if
      my age is still to be prolonged, <a href="#linknote-12"
      name="linknoteref-12" id="linknoteref-12"><small>12</small></a> I know
      that I cannot escape paying <a href="#linknote-13" name="linknoteref-13"
      id="linknoteref-13"><small>13</small></a> the penalty of old age, in
      increasing dimness of sight and dulness of hearing. I shall find myself
      slower to learn new lessons, and apter to forget the lessons I have
      learnt. And if to these be added the consciousness of failing powers, the
      sting of self-reproach, what prospect have I of any further joy in living?
      It may be, you know," he added, "that God out of his great kindness is
      intervening in my behalf <a href="#linknote-14" name="linknoteref-14"
      id="linknoteref-14"><small>14</small></a> to suffer me to close my life in
      the ripeness of age, and by the gentlest of deaths. For if at this time
      sentence of death be passed upon me, it is plain I shall be allowed to
      meet an end which, in the opinion of those who have studied the matter, is
      not only the easiest in itself, but one which will cause the least trouble
      to one's friends, <a href="#linknote-15" name="linknoteref-15"
      id="linknoteref-15"><small>15</small></a> while engendering the deepest
      longing for the departed. For of necessity he will only be thought of with
      regret and longing who leaves nothing behind unseemly or discomfortable to
      haunt the imagination of those beside him, but, sound of body, and his
      soul still capable of friendly repose, fades tranquilly away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt," he added, "the gods were right in opposing me at that time
      (touching the inquiry, what I was to say in my defence), <a
      href="#linknote-16" name="linknoteref-16" id="linknoteref-16"><small>16</small></a>
      when you all thought the great thing was to discover some means of
      acquittal; <a href="#linknote-17" name="linknoteref-17" id="linknoteref-17"><small>17</small></a>
      since, had I effected that, it is clear I should have prepared for myself,
      not that surcease from life which is in store for me anon, but to end my
      days wasted by disease, or by old age, on which a confluent stream of evil
      things most alien to joyousness converges." <a href="#linknote-18"
      name="linknoteref-18" id="linknoteref-18"><small>18</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he added, "God knows I shall display no ardent zeal to bring that
      about. <a href="#linknote-19" name="linknoteref-19" id="linknoteref-19"><small>19</small></a>
      On the contrary, if by proclaiming all the blessings which I owe to god
      and men; if, by blazoning forth the opinion which I entertain with regard
      to myself, I end by wearying the court, even so will I choose death rather
      than supplicate in servile sort for leave to live a little longer merely
      to gain a life impoverished in place of death."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this determination, Hermogenes states, that, when the
      prosecution accused him of not recognising the gods recognised by the
      state, but introducing novel divinities and corrupting the young, Socrates
      stepped forward and said: "In the first place, sirs, I am at a loss to
      imagine on what ground <a href="#linknote-20" name="linknoteref-20"
      id="linknoteref-20"><small>20</small></a> Meletus asserts that I do not
      recognise the gods which are recognised by the state, since, as far as
      sacrificing goes, the rest of the world who have chanced to be present
      have been in the habit of seeing me so engaged at common festivals, and on
      the public altars; and so might Meletus himself, if he had wished. And as
      to novel divinities, how, pray, am I supposed to introduce them by stating
      that I have a voice <a href="#linknote-21" name="linknoteref-21"
      id="linknoteref-21"><small>21</small></a> from God which clearly signifies
      to me what I ought do do? Why, what else do those who make use of the
      cries of birds or utterances of men draw their conclusions from if not
      from voices? Who will deny that the thunder has a voice and is a very
      mighty omen; <a href="#linknote-22" name="linknoteref-22"
      id="linknoteref-22"><small>22</small></a> and the priestess on her tripod
      at Pytho, <a href="#linknote-23" name="linknoteref-23" id="linknoteref-23"><small>23</small></a>
      does not she also proclaim by voice the messages from the god? The god, at
      any rate, has foreknowledge, and premonishes those whom he will of what is
      about to be. That is a thing which all the world believes and asserts even
      as I do. Only, when they describe these premonitions under the name of
      birds and utterances, tokens <a href="#linknote-24" name="linknoteref-24"
      id="linknoteref-24"><small>24</small></a> and soothsayers, I speak of a
      divinity, and in using that designation I claim to speak at once more
      exactly and more reverentially than they do who ascribe the power of the
      gods to birds. And that I am not lying against the Godhead I have this as
      a proof: although I have reported to numbers of friends the counsels of
      heaven, I have never at any time been shown to be a deceiver or deceived."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they listened to these words the judges murmured their dissent, some as
      disbelieving what was said, and others out of simple envy that Socrates
      should actually receive from heaven more than they themselves; whereupon
      Socrates returned to the charge. "Come," he said, "lend me your ears while
      I tell you something more, so that those of you who choose may go to a
      still greater length in refusing to believe that I am thus highly honoured
      by the divine powers. Chaerephon <a href="#linknote-25"
      name="linknoteref-25" id="linknoteref-25"><small>25</small></a> once, in
      the presence of many witnesses, put a question at Delhi concerning me, and
      Apollo answered that there was no human being more liberal, or more
      upright, or more temperate than myself." And when once more on hearing
      these words the judges gave vent, as was only natural, to a fiercer murmur
      of dissent, Socrates once again spoke: "Yet, sirs, they were still greater
      words which the god spake in oracle concerning Lycurgus, <a
      href="#linknote-26" name="linknoteref-26" id="linknoteref-26"><small>26</small></a>
      the great lawgiver of Lacedaemon, than those concerning me. It is said
      that as he entered the temple the god addressed him with the words: 'I am
      considering whether to call thee god or man.' Me he likened not indeed to
      a god, but in excellence <a href="#linknote-27" name="linknoteref-27"
      id="linknoteref-27"><small>27</small></a> preferred me far beyond other
      men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still I would not have you accept this even on the faith of the god too
      rashly; rather I would have you investigate, point by point, what the god
      has said. I ask you, is there any one <a href="#linknote-28"
      name="linknoteref-28" id="linknoteref-28"><small>28</small></a> else, you
      know of, less enslaved than myself to the appetites <a href="#linknote-29"
      name="linknoteref-29" id="linknoteref-29"><small>29</small></a> of the
      body? Can you name another man of more independent spirit than myself,
      seeing that I accept from no one either gifts or pay? Whom have you any
      right to believe to be more just <a href="#linknote-30"
      name="linknoteref-30" id="linknoteref-30"><small>30</small></a> than one
      so suited with what he has, that the things of others excite no craving in
      him? <a href="#linknote-31" name="linknoteref-31" id="linknoteref-31"><small>31</small></a>
      Whom would one reasonably deem wise, rather than such a one as myself,
      who, from the moment I began to understand things spoken, <a
      href="#linknote-32" name="linknoteref-32" id="linknoteref-32"><small>32</small></a>
      have never omitted to inquire into and learn every good thing in my power?
      And that I laboured not in vain, what more conclusive evidence than the
      fact that so many of my fellow-citizens who make virtue their pursuit, and
      many strangers also, choose my society in preference to that of others? <a
      href="#linknote-33" name="linknoteref-33" id="linknoteref-33"><small>33</small></a>
      And how are we to explain the fact that though all know well enough that I
      am wholly unable to repay them in money, so many are eager to present me
      with some gift? <a href="#linknote-34" name="linknoteref-34"
      id="linknoteref-34"><small>34</small></a> And what do you make of this&mdash;while
      no one dreams of dunning me for benefits conferred, hosts of people
      acknowledge debts of gratitude to myself? And what of this, that during
      the siege, <a href="#linknote-35" name="linknoteref-35" id="linknoteref-35"><small>35</small></a>
      while others were pitying themselves <a href="#linknote-36"
      name="linknoteref-36" id="linknoteref-36"><small>36</small></a> I lived in
      no greater straits than when the city was at the height of her prosperity?
      and of this, that while others provide themselves with delicacies <a
      href="#linknote-37" name="linknoteref-37" id="linknoteref-37"><small>37</small></a>
      of the market at great cost, mine are the dainties of the soul more sweet
      than theirs, <a href="#linknote-38" name="linknoteref-38"
      id="linknoteref-38"><small>38</small></a> procured without expense? If in
      all I have said about myself no one can convict me of lying, is it not
      obvious that the praise I get from gods and men is justly earned? And yet
      in spite of all, Meletus, you will have it that by such habits I corrupt
      the young. We know, I fancy, what such corrupting influences are; and
      perhaps you will tell us if you know of any one who, under my influence,
      has been changed from a religious into an irreligious man; who, from being
      sober-minded, has become prodigal; from being a moderate drinker has
      become a wine-bibber and a drunkard; from being a lover of healthy honest
      toil has become effeminate, or under the thrall of some other wicked
      pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, bless my soul," exclaimed Meletus, "I know those whom you persuaded
      to obey yourself rather than the fathers who begat them." <a
      href="#linknote-39" name="linknoteref-39" id="linknoteref-39"><small>39</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admit it," Socrates replied, "in the case of education, for they know
      that I have made the matter a study; and with regard to health a man
      prefers to obey his doctor rather than his parents; in the public assembly
      the citizens of Athens, I presume, obey those whose arguments exhibit the
      soundest wisdom rather than their own relations. And is it not the case
      that, in your choice of generals, you set your fathers and brothers, and,
      bless me! your own selves aside, by comparison with those whom you believe
      to be the wisest authorities on military matters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt, Socrates," replied Meletus, "because it is expedient and
      customary so to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then," rejoined Socrates, "does it not strike even you, Meletus, as
      wonderful when in all ordinary concerns the best people should obtain, I
      do not say only an equal share, but an exclusive preference; but in my
      case, simply because I am selected by certain people as an adept in
      respect of the greatest treasure men possess&mdash;education, I am on that
      account to be prosecuted by you, sir, on the capital charge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Much more than this, it stands to reason, was urged, whether by himself or
      by the friends who advocated his cause. <a href="#linknote-40"
      name="linknoteref-40" id="linknoteref-40"><small>40</small></a> But my
      object has not been to mention everything that arose out of the suit. It
      suffices me to have shown on the one hand that Socrates, beyond
      everything, desired not to display impiety to heaven, <a
      href="#linknote-41" name="linknoteref-41" id="linknoteref-41"><small>41</small></a>
      and injustice to men; and on the other, that escape from death was not a
      thing, in his opinion, to be clamoured for importunately&mdash;on the
      contrary, he believed that the time was already come for him to die. That
      such was the conclusion to which he had come was made still more evident
      later when the case had been decided against him. In the first place, when
      called upon to suggest a counter-penalty, <a href="#linknote-42"
      name="linknoteref-42" id="linknoteref-42"><small>42</small></a> he would
      neither do so himself nor suffer his friends to do so for him, but went so
      far as to say that to propose a counter-penalty was like a confession of
      guilt. And afterwards, when his companions wished to steal him out of
      prison, <a href="#linknote-43" name="linknoteref-43" id="linknoteref-43"><small>43</small></a>
      he would not follow their lead, but would seem to have treated the idea as
      a jest, by asking "whether they happened to know of some place outside
      Attica where death was forbidden to set foot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      When the trial drew to an end, we are told, the master said: <a
      href="#linknote-44" name="linknoteref-44" id="linknoteref-44"><small>44</small></a>
      "Sirs, those who instructed the witnesses that they ought to perjure
      themselves and bear false witness against me, alike with those who
      listened to their instruction, must be conscious to themselves of a deep
      impiety and injustice. <a href="#linknote-45" name="linknoteref-45"
      id="linknoteref-45"><small>45</small></a> But for myself, what reason have
      I at the present time to hold my head less high than I did before sentence
      was passed against me, if I have not been convicted of having done any of
      those things whereof my accusers accused me? It has not been proved
      against me that I have sacrificed to novel divinities in place of Zeus and
      Hera and the gods who form their company. I have not taken oath by any
      other gods, nor named their name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then the young&mdash;how could I corrupt them by habituating them to
      manliness and frugality? since not even my accusers themselves allege
      against me that I have committed any of those deeds <a href="#linknote-46"
      name="linknoteref-46" id="linknoteref-46"><small>46</small></a> of which
      death is the penalty, such as robbery of temples, <a href="#linknote-47"
      name="linknoteref-47" id="linknoteref-47"><small>47</small></a> breaking
      into houses, selling freemen into slavery, or betrayal of the state; so
      that I must still ask myself in wonderment how it has been proved to you
      that I have done a deed worthy of death. Nor yet again because I die
      innocently is that a reason why I should lower my crest, for that is a
      blot not upon me but upon those who condemned me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For me, I find a certain consolation in the case of Palamedes, <a
      href="#linknote-48" name="linknoteref-48" id="linknoteref-48"><small>48</small></a>
      whose end was not unlike my own; who still even to-day furnishes a far
      nobler theme of song than Odysseus who unjustly slew him; and I know that
      testimony will be borne to me also by time future and time past that I
      never wronged another at any time or ever made a worse man of him, <a
      href="#linknote-49" name="linknoteref-49" id="linknoteref-49"><small>49</small></a>
      but ever tried to benefit those who practised discussion with me, teaching
      them gratuitously every good thing in my power."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having so said he turned and went in a manner quite in conformity <a
      href="#linknote-50" name="linknoteref-50" id="linknoteref-50"><small>50</small></a>
      with the words which he had spoken&mdash;so bright an air was discernible
      alike in the glance of his eye, his gesture, and his step.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he perceived those who followed by his side in tears, "What is
      this?" he asked. "Why do you weep now? <a href="#linknote-51"
      name="linknoteref-51" id="linknoteref-51"><small>51</small></a> Do you not
      know that for many a long day, ever since I was born, sentence of death
      was passed upon me by nature? If so be I perish prematurely while the tide
      of life's blessings flows free and fast, certainly I and my well-wishers
      should feel pained; but if it be that I am bringing my life to a close on
      the eve of troubles, for my part I think you ought all of you to take
      heart of grace and rejoice in my good fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was a certain Apollodorus, <a href="#linknote-52"
      name="linknoteref-52" id="linknoteref-52"><small>52</small></a> who was an
      enthusiastic lover of the master, but for the rest a simple-minded man. He
      exclaimed very innocently, "But the hardest thing of all to bear,
      Socrates, is to see you put to death unjustly." <a href="#linknote-53"
      name="linknoteref-53" id="linknoteref-53"><small>53</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Socrates, it is said, gently stroked the young man's head:
      "Would you have been better pleased, my dear one, to see me put to death
      for some just reason rather than unjustly?" and as he spoke he smiled
      tenderly. <a href="#linknote-54" name="linknoteref-54" id="linknoteref-54"><small>54</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also said that, seeing Anytus <a href="#linknote-55"
      name="linknoteref-55" id="linknoteref-55"><small>55</small></a> pass by,
      Socrates remarked: "How proudly the great man steps; he thinks, no doubt,
      he has performed some great and noble deed in putting me to death, and all
      because, seeing him deemed worthy of the highest honours of the state, I
      told him it ill became him to bring up his so in a tan-yard. <a
      href="#linknote-56" name="linknoteref-56" id="linknoteref-56"><small>56</small></a>
      What a scamp the fellow is! he appears not to know that of us two
      whichever has achieved what is best and noblest for all future time is the
      real victor in this suit. Well! well!" he added, "Homer <a
      href="#linknote-57" name="linknoteref-57" id="linknoteref-57"><small>57</small></a>
      has ascribed to some at the point of death a power of forecasting things
      to be, and I too am minded to utter a prophecy. Once, for a brief space, I
      associated with the son of Anytus, and he seemed to me not lacking in
      strength of soul; and what I say is, he will not adhere long to the
      slavish employment which his father has prepared for him, but, in the
      absence of any earnest friend and guardian, he is like to be led into some
      base passion and go to great lengths in depravity."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prophecy proved true. The young man fell a victim to the pleasures of
      wine; night and day he never ceased drinking, and at last became a mere
      good-for-nothing, worthless alike to his city, his friends, and himself.
      As to Anytus, even though the grave has closed upon him, his evil
      reputation still survives him, due alike to his son's base bringing-up and
      his own want of human feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socrates did, it is true, by his self-laudation draw down upon him the
      jealousy of the court and caused his judges all the more to record their
      votes against him. Yet even so I look upon the lot of destiny which he
      obtained as providential, <a href="#linknote-58" name="linknoteref-58"
      id="linknoteref-58"><small>58</small></a> chancing as he did upon the
      easiest amidst the many shapes of death, <a href="#linknote-59"
      name="linknoteref-59" id="linknoteref-59"><small>59</small></a> and
      escaping as he did the one grievous portion of existence. And what a
      glorious chance, moreover, he had to display the full strength of his
      soul, for when once he had decided that death was better for him than
      life, just as in the old days he had never harshly opposed himself to the
      good things of life morosely, <a href="#linknote-60" name="linknoteref-60"
      id="linknoteref-60"><small>60</small></a> so even in face of death he
      showed no touch of weakness, but with gaiety welcomed death's embrace, and
      discharged life's debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself indeed, as I lay to mind the wisdom of the man and his
      nobility, I can neither forget him nor, remembering him, forbear to praise
      him. But if any of those who make virtue their pursuit have ever met a
      more helpful friend than Socrates, I tender such an one my congratulations
      as a most enviable man.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
